# Video homework for 11/25

Hi guys, this is Peter, I'm traveling at the moment and won't be able to make it back in time for your class.

I would like you guys to spend 2 hours and 30 minutes watching and following through 
this youtube video I found really helpful in learning React.

The video will walk you through how to develop a simple React app that does some
really cool stuff (counting movies).

I expect to see this app finished and running on both of your computers by next week,
treat this assignment seriously because if you don't finish you will each do 150 pushups (no break).

If Wilson doesn't finish, Derek will do 50 extra pushups regardless of whether or not Derek finishes, vice versa.

You should both already have React installed on your computers.
